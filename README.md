### Why did I make Scratchpad?

-   Even with fancy notetaking apps and organized zettelkasten setups, I found myself opening text files to dump my daily scattered thoughts
-   I didn't want to put my fleeting insights (that may or may not be useful in the future) into organized systems but rather have a place that's designed to be messy, an extension of my working memory, and reflective of the messy creative process.
-   ... and I wanted an excuse to learn Electron, to jump out of my bubble of web dev projects with the only stack I know (NextJS/MongoDB).

### How does it work?

Scratchpad saves and opens markdown files in a "vault" which is just a folder with all markdown files nested 2 layers of folders underneath.

### Why use Scratchpad?

-   No sign-ins
-   No internet needed
-   No privacy concerns
-   No bloated interfaces
-   Just markdown files
