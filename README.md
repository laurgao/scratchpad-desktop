### Why use dotTodo?

-   No sign-ins
-   No internet needed
-   No privacy concerns
-   No bloated interfaces
-   Just lists

### How does it work?

dotTodo saves and opensÂ `.todo`Â files, which are really just text files with markdown-style lists:

```
- [] advertise dotTodo
- [x] lgcs readings
- [] dotTodo write-up
- [] dotTodo landing page
- [] poli5 reading notes
- [] hist62 extended keyword
- [x] updately 0.8.0
- [x] lgcs revisions
- [x] updately 0.8.0 email
```

Under the hood it runs on Electron and React -- a bit overkill but this makes it easy for me, primarily a web developer, to maintain the app. Check out theÂ [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wwsalmon/dottodo)Â here.

### Why did I make dotTodo?

-   Even with other task management and todo-list tools, I found myself making temporary markdown files with lists
-   ...and I wanted an excuse to make a pretty Electron app
-   Write-up on what I learned here (coming soon)
